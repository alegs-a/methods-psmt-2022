\section{Assumptions and observations}
    \subsection{Assumptions}
    
    Dam is not tidal, no flow in from rivers, no water is released either; the
    water level will not change.

    Bacteria will not begin to compete for food source etc, meaning that their
    growth will continue its upwards trend; the only limiting factor in the
    lake's bacteria population is the lake's size.

    \subsection{Observations}

    dam passes vertical line test, meaning it can be modelled as as function
